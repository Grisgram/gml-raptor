	DO NOT DELETE/REMOVE THE VERSION FILE FROM THE NOTES!
	
	There is a build batch for raptor (pre_project_step.bat) included in the project,
	that uses this file as input to count up the build numbers.
	This script also compiles/encrypts your json datafiles for beta/release builds.
	
	You do NOT need to edit the "version.json" in the included files,
	instead, just edit the version file here in the notes and set your major and minor
	versions as you need, but don't modify the BUILD value, it is counted automatically for you.
