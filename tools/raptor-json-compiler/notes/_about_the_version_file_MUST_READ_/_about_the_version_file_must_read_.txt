	DO NOT DELETE/REMOVE THE VERSION FILE FROM THE NOTES!
	
	There is a build batch for the pre-build-step (pre_build_step.bat)
	included in the project that uses this file as input to count up the build numbers.
	
	You do NOT need to edit the "version.json" in the included files!
	Instead, just edit the version file here in the notes and set your major and minor
	versions as you need, but leave the BUILD alone.
