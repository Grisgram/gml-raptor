	Welcome to the gml-raptor template!
	
	Please follow these two simple steps to setup your project:
	
	1) ONLY IF YOU MAKE A HTML-GAME:
	   Edit "index.html" from the "Included Files" folder,
	   and find the script line (line ~80), which executes your game, it looks like this:
	   <script type="text/javascript" src="game/gml-raptor.js?cachebust=435882189"></script>
	   
	   Replace "gml-raptor.js" with "your_project_name.js" (the name shown in the title bar of the IDE).
	   
	2) RELEVANT, BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR FIRST beta OR release BUILD:
	   Install the raptor-json-compiler setup
	   Make sure, you enabled the "Add to PATH" checkbox! Otherwise it won't work.
	
	When both steps are done, feel free to delete this file.
	
	That's it!
	Have fun! Make Games!
	Yours,
	Gris
