/*
	These callbacks get invoked from the GameStarter object in the
	GameStart and GameEnd events respectively.
	
	They have been created to encapsulate one-time-startup/-shutdown actions in
	an isolated script file, so you do not need to modify the GameStarter object directly
	in each game.
	
	onGameStart runs AFTER the ci_colors have been initialized.
	It is recommended, to set at least the app_theme in the onGameStart function, so 
	scribble gets initialized with the correct set of ci_colors.
	
	If the game is currently in HTML mode, HTML_LOCALES is used to set up the locale list.
	Note for locales: The first entry in the array is the fallback (default) language and
	should always contain 100% of all strings!
	
	------------------------------------------------------
	NOTE: HTML5 games never receive an onGameEnd callback!
