	This is the return value of a call to the query(...) function.
	query(...) returns an array of race_result_entry.


race_result_entry
-----------------

		name		= item name
		type		= objecttype (asset name)
		data		= race data_struct (enabled, chance, ...)
		attributes	= attributes of this item (= data.attributes)
		instance	= dropped instance (or undefined)

	All contained objects already exist on the layer and are instantiated.
	Their onCreate and onQueryHit events have already been executed.
	If no drop was generated, [instance] contains undefined.
	
	A note on attributes: If the race entry had not attributes, this member contains {}
	an empty struct and is never undefined.
