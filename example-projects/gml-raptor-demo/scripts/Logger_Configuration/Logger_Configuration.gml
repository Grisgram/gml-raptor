// Choose, which line formatter to use when writing a log
// Available are:
// - RaptorSimpleFormatter: Just prints the log level and the message 1:1 without additional information
// - RaptorFrameFormatter:  Precedes each log line with the current game frame number. Very useful for exact timing.
//                          With this formatter you can see the exact frame, when a line was written. This is the default.
// - RaptorTimeFormatter:   Instead of the game frame, this formatter precedes each line with the current_time, which is a
//							milliseconds value since the game was started. This is less exact than the RaptorFrameFormatter.

// The log level decides, which log lines will be printed to the log.
// A line must AT LEAST have the level specified here to be printed.
//
// The levels are: 0-Verbose, 1-Debug, 2-Info, 3-Warning, 4-Error, 5-Fatal
//
// !PLEASE NOTE! In the RingBuffer, ALL lines (excpect verbose) are stored in case of a crash and written 
// (encrypted with your FILE_CRYPT_KEY) to disk. If you report that crash log to your server, you have the FULL INFORMATION available!
// It's just the live log, you are filtering here (as an example, in a browser game, you only write Waring++ to the log
// if the user is live-watching the console)
//
// A note on verbose logging (level 0): This logs every single mouse_enter/leave event, each tooltip shown, everything!
// Turn it on in debug if you hunt a bug, but it's too much information for normal development
