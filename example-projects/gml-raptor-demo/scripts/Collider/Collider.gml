/*
    The Collider script is a set of functions that can help you determine,
	whether a collision event occurs for the first time or is ongoing.
	
	If the same collision appeared last frame, it is considered ongoing.
	The functions have no arguments, they use the keywords "self" and "other",
	as you would in a collision event, that's why they are global functions and
	not a constructor/class - to make sure, self and other point to the colliding 
	instances.
